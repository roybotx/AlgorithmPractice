/**
 * Given an integer, write an algorithm to convert it to hexadecimal. For negative integer, twoâ€™s complement method is used.
 * <p>
 * Note:
 * <p>
 * All letters in hexadecimal (a-f) must be in lowercase.
 * The hexadecimal string must not contain extra leading 0s. If the number is zero, it is represented by a single zero character '0'; otherwise, the first character in the hexadecimal string will not be the zero character.
 * The given number is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
 * You must not use any method provided by the library which converts/formats the number to hex directly.
 * Example 1:
 * <p>
 * Input:
 * 26
 * <p>
 * Output:
 * "1a"
 * Example 2:
 * <p>
 * Input:
 * -1
 * <p>
 * Output:
 * "ffffffff"

    /**Complexity Analysis

     Uniform cost model is used as Cost Model and `n` is the input number. `b` in this case would be `16.

     Time Complexity:

     Best Case `O(log_b(n))` : With respect to the input, the algorithm will always depend on the size of input.
     Average Case `O(log_b(n))` : With respect to the input, the algorithm will always depend on the size of input.
     Worst Case `O(log_b(n))` : With respect to the input, the algorithm will always depend on the size of input.
     Auxiliary Space:

     Worst Case `O(log_b(n))` : With respect to the input, the algorithm will always depend on the size of input.
     Algorithm

     Approach: Divide and Modding

     To deal with negative number, the number is masked against long data type. This process will convert it to a positive long number. A simple while loop is then use to extract each base digit until number becomes `0`.

     For Integer.MAX_VALUE or Integer.MIN_VALUE or any input with 8 Hexadecimal characters where the iterations would last the longest. For Integer.MAX_VALUE the algorithm will run for at most `ceil(log_16 (2^31 - 1) + 1) = 8` times.*/

     Algorithm

     Approach: Shifting and Masking

     Number is masked against binary of 1111 each time to get the component value which is then mapped to corresponding character. >>> is used to right-shifted `4` bit positions with zero-extension. The zero-extension will naturally deal with negative number.

     StringBuilder is used due to its efficiently in inserting character to existing StringBuilder object. If normal String is used then each insertion by + operation will have to copy over the immutable String object which is highly inefficient.

     For Integer.MAX_VALUE or Integer.MIN_VALUE or any input with 8 Hexadecimal characters where the iterations would last the longest. For Integer.MAX_VALUE the algorithm will run for at most `ceil(log_16 (2^31 - 1) + 1) = 8` times.*/
